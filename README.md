# clustering-algoritham-implementation
The project involves clustering analysis of a dataset using two popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms
K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. The goal is to identify patterns and structures in the data

*first step 
Import the necessary libraries to handle data manipulation, visualization, and clustering algorithms.

*import numpy as np

* import pandas as pd

* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

* import seaborn as sns

* from sklearn import datasets

* from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

* from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage, fcluster


Load the Iris dataset from the sklearn library.
Convert the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis then Visualize Data:

Use Seaborn to create a pair plot of the dataset  This helps in understanding the distribution and relationships between the features
Apply K-Means Clustering
   Includes scaling and handling missing values.
    Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifies and removes outliers to improve clustering accuracy.
    Clustering Algorithms:
        KMeans Clustering: Groups data into clusters based on feature similarity.
        Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters and visualizes them using a dendrogram.
    Visualizations:
        Box plots, 3D scatter plots, and dendrograms for clear data representation.
        Images of the three Iris species for visual reference.


Initialize the K-Means algorithm with the desired number of clusters (in this case, 3)
Fit the model to the dataset and predict the clusters for each sample.
Visualize the clusters using a scatter plot, with different colors representing different clusters after that 

Apply Hierarchical Clustering:

Use the linkage method from the scipy.cluster.hierarchy module to perform hierarchical clustering on the dataset.
Visualize the hierarchical clustering using a dendrogram.
Form flat clusters by cutting the dendrogram at a certain level and visualize these clusters using a scatter plot.
